If you Google ‘opioid crisis’, you are likely to find many articles that highlight the increase in deaths associated with opioid usage in the US over the past two decades. According to the CDC, drug overdose deaths nearly tripled during the period 1999 to 2014 which some commentators have ascribed to the concurrent increase in opioid prescription rate, which quadrupled from 1999 to 2010.  The response to this crisis has varied with some states enacting legislation to restrict opioid prescribing in the belief that this will reduce opioid addiction and therefore overdoses.  However, others have criticized this approach on the grounds that it could adversely impact individuals who need opioid based medications to manage chronic health conditions, and that it ignores the wider socio-economic factors that play a role in opioid addiction and overdose. 

This study examined the relationship between prescription rate, opioid overdose rate and poverty rate at a state level during 2006 to 2015.  Like much existing research, it found that opioid overdose death rates had increased significantly year-on-year.  However, it did not provide strong evidence that prescribing rate was associated with overdose rate, nor that poverty was associated with overdose rate.  This suggests that policy-makers should look to alternative strategies to dealing with the opioid crisis, other than simply restricting their prescription.
